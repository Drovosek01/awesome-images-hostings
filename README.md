## What kind of repository is this

This repository is a list of services where you can publish pictures and share them on the Internet. The services are presented in a comparative table and are divided into categories.

You can read more about the concept of "Awesome" lists [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md)

> Unfortunately, I can't always find the time to fill out a comparison table. If you have an opportunity to improve the repository (correct errors in the text or fill in items in the comparison table or something else) - do it and create a Pull Request

## What is image hosting?

Image hosting is a service that provides an opportunity to upload and store images, a link to which you can then share.

There are a huge number of image hosting services at the moment, with different functionality and, for some, distinctive features. All this will be discussed below.

For those who do not use many different Internet resources, I explain: in addition to the usual social networks, the exchange of pictures in which is a simple intuitive thing, there are a considerable number of resources on the Internet (I think these are mainly forums) in which, for certain reasons, the function of uploading pictures is not implemented (for example, in order to load the service itself less). And in order to share images on such resources, you need to upload images to image hosting sites, take a link to the image from there (preferably a direct link) and then paste it into a message on the necessary service.

## FAQ

Answers to predictable questions.

- Why is the information in the repository only in 2 languages? (English will be later)
  - Because my native language is Russian and it is more convenient for me to formulate thoughts in my native language. After that, I use online translators to translate from Russian to English. If you have the desire and the opportunity - make a full translation into another language and create a Pull Request

- Will there be a translation into other languages?
  - I do not plan to translate into other languages. If someone makes a complete translation of files into another language and creates a Pull-Request, I will add this translation, but I will not be able to support it (add new information if it is not just a jackdaw in the table)

- By what principle do services get into this list/table?
  - It's simple. If the service is designed to store images or you can upload images that are stored for a long time and you can get a direct link to them - we add it to the table with the appropriate category and try to find out about the properties of the service by filling in the items in the comparison table.

## Image Hosting vs Photo Hosting

// TODO: I think there is a difference between just hosting any pictures and hosting focused on photos, but I haven't studied this facet yet. When I have time, I will investigate this and write here (and then the TODO mark will disappear), but for now I suggest reading about it at the link below

https://geekflare.com/best-image-hosting/

## Service lists and comparison tables

Below are all the services known to me, to which you can upload pictures and share them. I have tried to add only the most important comparison criteria to the headings of the comparison tables. If the service has some rare feature, then the information about it will most likely be in the "Additional information" column.

I have tried to reduce the column headers to a minimum so that they do not lose their meaning. For more information about the meaning of the header, about what information is in each column, see the section "Explanation of the headers in the table" below.

I divided some services into different groups, although it was possible to make one large table and instead of groups, just add a separate column in the table, but I decided that the division into groups would be clearer, because the table turned out to be too big already.

## Explanation of the headers in the table

It is difficult to fit detailed information about what information is displayed in the column into the headers, so detailed information about each header from the comparison table will be in this section.

I tried to formulate the headings so that the answer "yes" in the column meant something positive about the service. Instead of a simple answer `Yes` or `No`, of course it is more convenient and expedient to put `+` or `-`.

1. Links - links to the service. If the resource has several mirror domains, then you need to specify them separated by commas `,`. Links to link shortening services that lead to viewing the image do not need to be specified in this column.
2. Anonymous use - is it possible to use the service without registering in it. Of course, with anonymous use, we are talking only about the main functionality - uploading images in various ways.
3. Multi-upload - is it possible to upload multiple files to the service at the same time. If the service provides information about the maximum number of simultaneously downloaded files, specify a number.
4. From the clipboard - is it possible to download an image copied to the clipboard.
5. Drag & Drop - is it possible to download by dragging an image from a computer directory to a page (or a specific area) service.
6. By link - is it possible to upload an image by specifying a direct link to it.
7. From the archive - is it possible to download several images in the form of an archive (so that the service unpacks it itself and makes it look as if all the images from the archive are downloaded separately).
8. File storage duration (anon/authorized) - the storage period of the image (standard in days) for authorized and non-authorized users via the slash `/`.
9. Maximum image size (MB) - the maximum image size in megabytes that can be stored on the service.
10. Maximum image resolution - the maximum image size in pixels that can be uploaded to the service.
11. Automatic resolution change - does the service automatically reduce the image if it exceeds the maximum allowed image size in pixels (of course, if there is a limit on the maximum image size in pixels).
12. Availability of the English interface - information about whether the service has an interface in English.
13. Abbreviated link to the image - information about whether it is possible to generate a short link to the page with the image view.
14. Allowed image formats - information about which images with which extensions are allowed to be uploaded to the service. The separator is a comma `,`.
15. Automatic conversion - information about which format the service converts the image from when downloading.
16. Preview image - information about whether the service can generate a thumbnail image of the uploaded image.
17. Adding an inscription to the preview - information about whether it is possible to add some text to the generated thumbnail.
18. Setting the preview size - information about whether it is possible to change the size in pixels for the generated thumbnail.
19. Embed codes - information about whether the service generates code for embedding images in HTML or other markup languages. Usually these codes are available on the page immediately after the image has been successfully uploaded or on the image viewing page. Different services generate different codes (a thumbnail with a link to the full version viewing page or the full version with a link to the service's homepage, etc.) there are not many of these options, and in a good way it is better to indicate in this column what types of embed codes the service provides, but so far I have no way to take into account all the options and it will be indicated simply the presence of whether any codes are generated for embedding the image.
20. Information about uploaded - information about whether there is information about the image on the viewing page. For example, the name of the uploaded file, the upload date, the size in pixels, the size in megabytes or kilobytes, the number of views, the nickname of the one who uploaded, etc. 
21. Viewing all photos of the service - information about whether it is possible to view all photos uploaded to the service on the service.
22. Search - information about whether there is a photo search on the service (usually it is a search exclusively by the names of uploaded images).
23. Viewing topics - information about whether there are any categories on the service that pictures are divided into and whether it is possible to view all the pictures in any separate category.
24. Viewing photos of other accounts - information about whether it is possible to go to someone's profile on the service and view photos of this profile (of course, provided that there is registration on the service).
25. Commenting - information about whether it is possible to leave a comment on the page with the image viewing on the service.
26. Likes - information about whether it is possible to like a picture on a page with a picture view on the service.
27. Image description - information about whether it is possible to add any text (description) to the uploaded image (usually the added text is displayed on the page with the image viewing on the service).
28. File Deletion - information about whether uploaded images can be deleted from the service.
29. File editing - information about whether it is possible to edit the uploaded image and the data added with its upload (the name of the image, the description to it, etc.).
30. Creating albums - information about whether it is possible to combine several images into one album (and, preferably, share a link to this album).
31. API - information about whether the service provides any API.
32. Adult materials - information about whether pornographic images are allowed (and, accordingly, whether they are present) on the service.
33. Additional information - information about the features of the service that do not fall under any of the above criteria.

## Rules for adding services to the list

- Services that do not provide the possibility of using without registration should go to the end of the list
- Services that do not provide free services should go to the end of the list
- Services without an interface in English should go to the end of the list
- Services without an explicit source of earnings should go to the end of the list
- When adding a date with a month, specify the month as a string, because different countries have different formats of numeric dates. Example - April 10, 2022
- Services without SSL (without https) should go to the end of the list
- Services for publishing only a certain type of images should go to the end of the list
- If the service has several domains - specify them in one cell separated by commas `,`

## Dead services

These are services that have stopped working. Just leave them here for the story.

You can find out more about them in [adjacent file](Dead_services_RU.md)

## Special thanks

There are many blogs on the Internet that compare different image storage services, but I want to mention these sites because they contain the most extensive information about different image hosting services and some information was borrowed from these sites:
